# Summary of Git Version Control

**Git** is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It helps teams collaborate, manage code history, and coordinate work efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Distributed System**: Each developer has a complete local copy of the repository.
- **Branching and Merging**: Create branches for new features or fixes, then merge them into the main codebase.
- **Commit History**: Track changes over time with messages explaining what was done and why.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously and merge their changes.
- **Staging Area**: Select specific changes to commit using the staging index.

## Basic Git Commands

- `git init` – Initialize a new Git repository  
- `git clone <repo>` – Clone a remote repository  
- `git status` – Show the status of changes  
- `git add <file>` – Stage changes for commit  
- `git commit -m "message"` – Commit staged changes  
- `git pull` – Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository  
- `git push` – Upload local commits to a remote repository  
- `git branch` – List or create branches  
- `git merge <branch>` – Merge a branch into the current one
